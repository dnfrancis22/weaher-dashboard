Click on the settings tab.
Scroll down to the section that says GitHub Pages.
Click on the link in the green box next to "your site is published at".

Or you can just click here: https://dnfrancis22.github.io/weather-dashboard/

**Usage**

When the page loads type the name of a city into the search field and click the search button. You will be presented with the current weather and a five daily forecast. A button will be generated that is linked to the city you searched for. When that button is clicked the weather information for that city will be recalled.
